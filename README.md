# Complete Numpy Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository presents an efficient implementation for a convolutional neural network library using only `numpy`. This library includes forward- and back-propagation of:
- Convolutional layers
- Pooling layers
- Activation functions
- Loss functions
- Batch normalization
- Linear layers
